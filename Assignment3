Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a function named 'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle.

#include <iostream>

class Area {
    private:
        int length;
        int breadth;
    public:
        Area(int l, int b) {
            length = l;
            breadth = b;
        }
        int returnArea() {
            return length * breadth;
        }
};

int main() {
    int l, b;
    std::cout << "Enter the length of the rectangle: ";
    std::cin >> l;
    std::cout << "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: ";
    std::cin >> b;
    Area rect(l, b);
    std::cout << "Area of the rectangle: " << rect.returnArea() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
